## Objective of the program

This is a program that simulates and manages chess games. The program accepts
moves in the format (source square, destination square), where a square is referred to using a letter
in the range A-H and a number in the range 1-8. It validates each move and keeps track of the state
of the game, detecting when the game is over and producing appropriate output to the user.
Appropriate class definitions have been written in C++ which correctly interface with the main program in
the file ChessMain.cpp. The main program contains an example chess game and code which tries to give
various kinds of erroneous input, which the implementation handles as indicated below in the sample output.
The makefile compiles the program and creates an executable file with the name chess.
